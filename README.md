Pauek's Slide Bag Clip
======================

This is a design from scratch inspired in the 
[Slide Bag Clip](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1919441) 
found in Thingiverse. A quite useful kitchen utensil, I would say.

This version is quite a bit easier to slide, and smaller.

Printing it
-----------

First open the ``slide_bag_clip.scad`` file in OpenSCAD. At the bottom of the
file there is a call to the ``clip`` function, in which you can tune several
parameters (most typically the ``length``). Change whatever you need, generate
the final mesh with F6, and then save the STL.
